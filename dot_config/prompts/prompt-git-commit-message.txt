Create a Git commit message in the Conventional Commit format.

The first line should be a type, followed by a colon, and then a short 72 charater description of the change.
The body of the commit message should be a bulleted list of the reasons why the changes were made.

Here are example Git commit messages:

```
feat: add new login page

- added login page so users can access system
- used tailwind + alpinejs
```
```
chore: updated tailwind dependency

- updated tailwind to version 2.0.2
```
```
docs: add section about file upload limits

- internal use only
```
